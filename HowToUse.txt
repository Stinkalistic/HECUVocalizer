To use HECUVocalizer, install the wave python library if you want to download the sounds and run hgruntspeaker.py. type in what you want to vocalize with a space between each word. If you enter a word that does not have a sound file it will not play that sound. To use the shouted version of a sound, add a ! at the end of the word or put it in caps. If there are any caps in a word it will use the shouted version. You can turn off downloading in the settings.
